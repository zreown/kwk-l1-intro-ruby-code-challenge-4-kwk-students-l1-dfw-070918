<img src="https://after-school-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/challenge.png" width="200px" align="right" hspace="10"> 

In the `least_coins.rb` file, write a method called `least_coins`.

Given a number of cents as an argument, the method should return a hash with the least number of coins that it would take to make that amount. For example, running `least_coins(29)` should return `{:quarters => 1, :dimes => 0, :nickels => 0, :pennies => 4}`. 

Run `learn` to check your answer!
